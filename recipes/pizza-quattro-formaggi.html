    <h1>Pizza Quattro Formaggi</h1>
    <img src="https://www.pizzacasaromana.ro/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Casa_Romana_11_Quattro_Formaggi.jpg">
    <h3>Quattro Formaggi Pizza is a traditional Italian pizza dating back to the 18th century that is topped with four different cheeses. Italians make this pizza either rossa (with tomato paste) or bianca (without tomato).</h3>
    <p>As you’ve probably guessed, the name is fairly self-explanatory. Indeed, in Italian, quattro means four and formaggi means cheeses. But, what is less obvious is which cheeses should you use?.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups plain Tipo 00 flour</li>
        <li>2 tsp fast action dried yeast</li>
        <li>320 ml lukewarm water</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>½ tsp sugar</li>
        <li>semolina flour for dusting</li>
        <li>2 balls Buffalo Mozzarella, grated</li>
        <li>100 g Gorgonzola Piccante, crumbled</li>
        <li>100 g Fontina, grated</li>
        <li>50 g Parmigiano Reggiano, grated</li>
        <li>200 g San Marzano tomatoes, crushed</li>
        <li>1 pinch black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To start, mix the flour, salt and yeast in a bowl making sure to put the salt and yeast at opposite sides.</li>
        <li>Make a well in the middle and pour in water and olive oil. Mix thoroughly until a scraggy dough forms. If the dough is too sticky, you can use a little more flour.</li>
        <li>Dust a clean section of your kitchen bench with a little flour and knead the dough for around 10 minutes until it’s smooth and elastic. If you lightly press your finger on the ball of dough it should spring back up easily.</li>
        <li>Coat a large clean bowl with ½ tablespoon of olive oil. Shape the dough into a ball and place in the bowl. And rub the top of the dough with a small amount of olive oil.</li>
        <li>Cover with beeswax wrap and leave in a warm place for up to 4 hours. Or until the dough has tripled in size.</li>
        <li>Pre-heat the oven to 450°F/230°C and add your baking trays to heat up.</li>
        <li>Cut the dough into 2 or 4 depending on how big you want your pizza. Then either roll out on a lightly floured surface with a rolling pin.</li>
        <li>Remove the baking tray from the oven and sprinkle with semolina or flour. Afterwards, carefully place the pizza dough on top.</li>
        <li>Spread the pizza base evenly with San Marzano tomato sauce and sprinkle with even amounts of cheese. Bake until melted, bubbling and golden (around 10-15 minutes).</li>
    </ol>
