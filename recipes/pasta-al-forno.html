    <h3>Pasta al Forno, an oven baked pasta with a creamy and cheesy sauce, is delicious and easy to make. This step by step recipe gives you detailed instructions on how to prepare this classic Italian dish.</h3>
    <p>If you love hearty, comfort food that is rich in flavor, you’ve come to the right place! My Pasta al Forno is incredibly tasty and satisfying but not difficult to prepare at all. Follow this recipe for complete success!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Rigatoni pasta - always look for good quality pasta. That doesn’t necessarily mean expensive. ​​Look for durum wheat semolina pasta that says “bronze die cut pasta”.</li>
        <li>Olive oil - regular olive oil gives great flavor to all Italian pasta recipes. You can use extra virgin olive oil if you prefer.</li>
        <li>Onion - white or brown onion is excellent and give a sweetness to this meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Ground pork - buy good quality ground pork that has some fat in it.</li>
        <li>Italian sausage - these are sold fresh and are made of pork and seasonings like fennel, anise, garlic and other spices.</li>
        <li>Tomato passata - this is just pureed tomato that has been strained of seeds and skins. I buy the Mutti brand which is a thick tomato passata but choose the brand you prefer.</li>
        <li>Mozzarella cheese - you should grate your own cheese. Avoid the pre-grated cheese because it contains preservatives to prevent clumping and this also means the cheese won’t melt as well.</li>
        <li>Pecorino Romano cheese - again grate your own cheese unless you have a good delicatessen that will grate it freshly for you.</li>
        <li>Salt and freshy ground black pepper - be sure to taste the meat sauce and season well with salt and pepper. It’s also important to salt the pasta water well.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Fry onion until golden then add skinned and crumbled sausage and ground pork. Fry until browned.</li>
        <li>Add tomato passata, reduce the heat and simmer partly covered for 30 minutes. Season to taste.</li>
        <li>Cook the pasta but drain when very al dente, reserving some cooking water. Combine pasta, mozzarella cheese, pecorino cheese and cooking water into the sauce. </li>
        <li>Tip into baking dish. Sprinkle on extra cheese and bake 320ºF/180ºC for 25 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
